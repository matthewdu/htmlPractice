        <p>Steins;Gate is without doubt the best anime of all time. Nothing else has ever compared. It is an anime that aims at every genre from suspense to humor, and it does each one spectacularly.</p>
        
        <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/3784/Evangelion:_2.0_You_Can_%28Not%29_Advance"><img src="http://evangelion.fateback.com/pic-eva-10.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Evangelion is the series that I fan the most about. Even though it is not nearly the best nor is it the the most engaging, it has a certain appeal to it. What pulled me in what the use of ancient religious allusions, and what kept me continue watching is the music and animation quality.</p>

        <p>The Type-Moon universe or Nasuverse as some call it is my favourit anime universe. I have spent more time reading it than any other wiki and it continues to baffle me with new information every time I read it. The every work by Nasu is somehow connected, and it's interesting to learn more about these connections.</p>
